            As a way of trying to minimise the e-waste around us, we the
            circular tech group has come up with a platform to curb the menace
            of electronic waste. This platform connects you to electrical
            appliances technicians around your area area. You can also sell the
            equipment that you don't require to the technicians or to other
            consumers.

          <p>
            This platfrom also enables technicians to connect with their fellow
            technicians. This way they can easily acquire spare parts amongst
            themselves. In a case where on technician can not repair your
            equipment he can easily scroll through this platform and find
            another technician who deals with that specific equipment.

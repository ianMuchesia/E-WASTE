        E-waste is simply waste from disposal of electrical or electronic waste. Examples of this electrical or electronic devices include refrigerators, mobile phones, microwaves, desktops etc. At most times we use this device until they get to their end life, sell them at a cheaper price and eventually they land in landfills, various toxic parts are burnt and dumped behind informal sector workshops or in their backyard for home appliances. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-center mt-2">Electronic scrap components, such as CPUs, contain potentially harmful materials such as lead, cadmium, beryllium or brominated flame retardants. Recycling and disposal of e-waste may involve significant risk to the health of workers and their communities.</p>
